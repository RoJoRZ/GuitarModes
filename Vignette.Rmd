## Package functionality

Find the positioning of different modes and ground tones on your guitar

Get a note from a given position:
```{r}
GetNote(string = 1,position = 3)
```

Get positions of a given note:
```{r}
Apositions <- GetPosition("A")
kable(Apositions)
```

Plot on a GuitarPlot
```{r, fig.height= 3, fig.width= 10}
GuitarPlot(Apositions, labsize = 0)
```

Get and plot the Ionian mode in C

```{r, fig.height= 3, fig.width= 10}
Ionian <- GetMode("C", "Ionian3")
GuitarPlot(Ionian, labsize = 3, firstfret = 5, lastfret = 15)
```

Or completely flexible generate any chord or setting in the plot

```{r}
Ecord <- data.frame(string = c(1,2,3,4,5,6), 
                    position = c(0,2,2,1,0,0), 
                    note = c("E", "B", "E", "G#/Ab","B", "E"))
GuitarPlot(Ecord, nfrets = 4, labsize = 4)
```
